👗 Fashion Recommender System

Visual Similarity Recommendation using FAISS (KNN) + Interactive Streamlit Application

📌 Project Overview

This project implements a content-based fashion recommendation system that retrieves visually similar products using deep image embeddings and FAISS-powered K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) search.

The system simulates how an e-commerce fashion retailer recommends similar items on a product detail page, integrating:

Image embedding representation

FAISS vector similarity search

Business-rule filtering

Front-facing image prioritisation

Interactive product-style interface

The focus of this implementation is the design, engineering, and integration of a KNN-based similarity pipeline into a production-style UI environment.

🎯 Business Motivation

In fashion e-commerce, visually similar recommendations help:

Increase cross-sell and basket size

Improve engagement on product pages

Maintain stylistic consistency

Encourage browsing behavior

This project simulates a real-world workflow where similarity retrieval must be combined with business constraints and UI requirements.

⚙️ Core Technical Components
1️⃣ Image Embedding Representation

Each product is represented by a fixed-length feature vector.

Embeddings capture visual patterns beyond metadata or category labels.

Enables scalable similarity-based comparison.

2️⃣ FAISS-Based KNN Retrieval

FAISS used for efficient nearest-neighbour search.

Supports configurable parameters:

top_k

similarity threshold

category filtering

stock filtering

Designed to scale to large embedding collections.

FAISS is widely adopted in industry for vector search systems.

3️⃣ Business Filtering Layer

After KNN retrieval, additional constraints are applied:

Remove the query product itself

Enforce same gender consistency

Optional same-category filtering

Similarity threshold control (e.g., ≥ 0.50)

Deduplicate results

This simulates production-level recommendation logic rather than raw similarity output.

4️⃣ Front-Facing Image Prioritisation

To ensure UI consistency:

Automatically selects *_front.jpg if available

Falls back to alternative product images if necessary

Preserves original metadata

Uses cached lookup to avoid repeated directory scanning

This resolves common mismatches between metadata image paths and actual file structure.

5️⃣ Interactive Streamlit Product Interface

The application simulates a real e-commerce product detail page with:

Main product display

Top-5 visually similar recommendations

Gender and category filters

Deterministic pricing generation for reproducibility

Session-state controlled product switching

Modular retrieval and rendering separation

The UI demonstrates how ML outputs integrate into a product-facing application.
